## R Package Installer Deconstruction

The goal behind this project is to see how the underlying R installer package is created.
We do this by reverse engineering the installer package using the `pkgutil` tool. 
Alternative, you can use "Show Package Contents" on the right click context menu. 

### Overview of Tracked Files

- [Scripts](Scripts/): Shell scripts run by the installer
    - [postflight](Scripts/postflight)
        - Run after files have been installed for the **first time only**. 
        - Launches before the `postflight` script if one is included in `/scripts`.
    - [postinstall](Scripts/postinstall)
        - Run after all files have been installed.
